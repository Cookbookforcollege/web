                    <h3>Breakfast and Academic Success</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Students who regularly consume breakfast show improved concentration, better memory recall, and higher academic performance. A balanced breakfast including protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats provides sustained energy for morning classes.</p>

                    <h3>Nutrition and Academic Performance</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Research shows that students who consume antioxidant-rich foods like blueberries, dark chocolate, and leafy greens demonstrate improved memory retention and cognitive function. The flavonoids in these foods enhance blood flow to the brain and support neural communication.</p>

                    <h3>Food and Sleep Quality</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Consuming tart cherries or cherry juice can naturally increase melatonin levels, improving sleep quality. Avoiding large meals, caffeine, and alcohol 3-4 hours before bedtime can significantly enhance your sleep cycles and academic performance.</p>

                    <h3>Protein Distribution Matters</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Your body can effectively utilize approximately 20-30 grams of protein per meal for muscle synthesis. Distributing protein intake throughout the day, rather than consuming large amounts at dinner, optimizes muscle maintenance and metabolism.</p>

                    <h3>Phytonutrient Diversity</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Different colored fruits and vegetables provide unique phytonutrients and antioxidants. Eating a variety of colors ensures you receive a comprehensive range of vitamins, minerals, and protective compounds that support immune function and overall health.</p>

                    <h3>Healthy Fats and Brain Function</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Omega-3 fatty acids from sources like walnuts, chia seeds, and fatty fish are essential for brain health. These fats support cognitive function, mood regulation, and may help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression common in college students.</p>

                    <h3>Hydration and Cognitive Function</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Even mild dehydration (2% of body weight) can significantly impair cognitive performance, memory, and mood. Students should aim for 8-10 glasses of water daily, with increased intake during stress periods and physical activity.</p>

                    <h3>Gut Health and Mental Wellness</h3>
                </div>
                <p>The gut-brain connection is particularly important for college students. Consuming probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, kefir, and fermented vegetables can support both digestive health and mental wellness, potentially reducing stress and anxiety.</p>

                    <h3>Meal Timing and Metabolism</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Eating regular meals every 3-4 hours helps maintain stable blood sugar levels, supporting consistent energy and concentration throughout the day. Skipping meals can lead to overeating later and decreased metabolic efficiency.</p>

                    <h3>Micronutrient Deficiencies in Students</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Common deficiencies among college students include vitamin D, iron, and B vitamins. These deficiencies can lead to fatigue, poor concentration, and weakened immune function. A varied diet with fortified foods can help prevent these issues.</p>
