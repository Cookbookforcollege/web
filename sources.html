            <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 20px;">How to Evaluate Nutrition Information</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Check Credentials:</strong> Look for information from registered dietitians, accredited universities, or government health agencies.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Seek Peer Review:</strong> Prioritize information published in peer-reviewed journals or endorsed by professional organizations.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Avoid Extreme Claims:</strong> Be skeptical of sources promising rapid results or claiming single foods can cure diseases.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Consider Context:</strong> Evaluate whether recommendations are appropriate for your individual circumstances, health status, and lifestyle.</p>
            <p><strong>Cross-Reference Sources:</strong> Compare information across multiple reputable sources to identify consistent, evidence-based recommendations.</p>
