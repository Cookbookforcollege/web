                <div class="tip-grid">
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h4>Strategic List Planning</h4>
                        <p>Create detailed shopping lists organized by store layout. Stick to your list to avoid impulse purchases that can inflate your budget by 20-30%.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h4>Frozen and Canned Alternatives</h4>
                        <p>Frozen vegetables often contain more nutrients than fresh produce that has traveled long distances. Canned goods provide shelf stability and cost savings.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h4>End-of-Day Shopping</h4>
                        <p>Many stores mark down perishable items after 6 PM. This is an excellent opportunity to purchase quality proteins and produce at significant discounts.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h4>Strategic Bulk Purchasing</h4>
                        <p>Rice, dried beans, pasta, and oats are excellent bulk purchases. Calculate per-unit costs to ensure genuine savings on larger quantities.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h4>Digital Tools and Apps</h4>
                        <p>Utilize store apps, digital coupons, and price comparison tools. Many stores offer exclusive app-based promotions and loyalty rewards.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h4>Seasonal Shopping Awareness</h4>
                        <p>Purchase fruits and vegetables during peak season for optimal pricing and quality. Learn local growing seasons to maximize your purchasing power.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h4>Generic Brand Selection</h4>
                        <p>Store brands typically offer 15-30% savings with comparable quality. Start with basic ingredients like flour, sugar, and canned goods.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h4>Meal Planning Integration</h4>
                        <p>Plan meals around sale items and seasonal produce. This approach can reduce food costs by 25% while improving meal variety.</p>
